You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you? Dade! Turn the shower off! You screw up again and you won't get into college! -- Mrs. Murphy
<crash> Give me time!
<burn> Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
I'm Mr. Simpson. And I'm subbing for Ms. Bayliss who was arrested at the anti-fur rally. I know some of you kids got computers at home. But these are school property, people, and I don't want to see any gum stuck to 'em. Chapter 1. Designing graphical interface... -- Dade Murphy's substitute teacher
<ramon> So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
<phreak> What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
<crash>  The name rings no bells with Dade.
<phreak> The Phantom Phreak? The king of Nynex? I know you play the game.

<phreak> Joey, Joey...
<joey>   What? whatwhatwhat?

<guest54473> I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
<joey>   Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
<phreak> You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
<phreak> Ultra Laser.
<phreak> Doctor Doom!
<cereal> Check this out, each and every one of you. Compilation tape, of my own making. I call this the "Greatest Zooks Album". Featuring artists like, well I got some Hendrix on there, some Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi... all great artists that asphyxiated on their own vomit! ... Can't get this in stores, man I made it!
<crash> Well, it looks like I'm on top.
<phreak> Congratulations. No one's ever beat her before. You just made an enemy for life.
<phreak> Boy meets world. Let's go?
<crash>  Who's that?
<phreak> Curtis.
<crash>  And what's he do?
<phreak> That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
<burn>  What the hell is going on?
<crash> Pool on the roof must have a leak.
<phreak> Man, oh man, this is gonna be good.
<burn> If God gave men brains bigger than dogs', they wouldn't hump womens' legs at cocktail parties. -- Ruth Libby
<burn>    He's not in this class.
<crash>   I said give me time.
<burn>    He's not enrolled in this class.
<teacher> Well, he's on my list.
<teacher> "Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most?"
<cereal>  Ozzy Osbourne!
<teacher> You. What is your name?
<cereal>  Uh, Emmanuel Goldstein, sir?
<teacher> You, however, are not on my list.
<cereal>  Whoa, this isn't wood shop class?
<mrsmurphy> What did we learn in school today?
<crash>     Revenge.
<crash> Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
<cereal> FYI, alright man, you can sit at home, and do ... *long pause* ... and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
<phreak> Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
<joey>   Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
<phreak> D'you bring those Crayola books?
<cereal> Oh yeah, technicolor rainbow... Green one.
<joey>   What is that, what is that? Lemmie see. What are these?
<crash>  International Unix Environments.
<cereal> Luscious orange?
<crash>   Computer security criteria, DOD standards.
* cereal pulls out another book
<crash>   The Pink Shirt Book, Guide to IBM PCs. So called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy wears on the cover.
* cereal pulls out yet another book
<cereal> What's that?
<crash>   Devil book. The Unix Bible.
* cereal pulls out another
<cereal> What's that?
<crash>   Dragon book. Compiler design.
* cereal pulls out the last book
<cereal> Oh yeah? What's that?
<crash>   The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
<joey> Anyway, anyway, guys guys guys, come on. I'm in this computer, right. So I'm looking around, looking around, you know, throwing commands at it, I don't know where it is or what it does or anything. It's like, it's like choice, it's just beautiful, okay. Like four hours I'm just messing around in there. Finally I figure out, that it's a bank. Right, okay wait, okay, so it's a bank. So, this morning, I look in the paper, some cash machine in like Bumsville Idaho, spits out seven hundred dollars into the middle of the street.
<joey>   That was me. That was me. I did that.
<crash>  You did this from your house.
* joey grins
<phreak> What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
<cereal> Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
<joey>   You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
<phreak> Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
<joey>   Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
<cereal> Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
<phreak> Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
<cereal> Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
<phreak> Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
<crash>   Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
* cereal rubs his nipples
<cereal> Wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
<phreak> Yo, who ate all of my fries?
<joey> YES! Home run, home run. You and me Lucy. We're gonna show em baby.
<hal>    Mr. Belford?
<plague> My name is the Plague.
<hal>    Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
<plague> As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
<hal>    Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker.
<joey>   Okay, okay, we need proof that we were here. Right, uh... Yeah, Garbage, okay, give me Garbage.
<plague> Never fear. I is here.
<hal>    I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
<plague> Let's echo 23, see what's up.
<plague> "God" wouldn't be up this late.
<crash>   You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
<phreak> No, don't know who he is.
<nikon> What, your mom buy you a 'Puter for Christmas?
<gill>  Hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses, and stealing materials for their own ends. These people, they are terrorists.
<cereal> Agent Richard Gill, You're hacker enemy number one, man. You're a boner!
<razor> Welcome to our show!
<blade> Hack the Planet!
Hack the planet!
<blade> Jolt Cola! The soft drink of the elite hacker.
<razor> That's right, this IS a payphone.
<blade> Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
<gill> In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
<margo>  Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
<plague> Once again, don't call me Eugene.
<plague> A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
<plague> Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the four most used passwords are love, sex, secret and...
* plague eyes margo
<plague> ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
<plague> A hacker planted the virus.
<margo>  Virus?
<plague> I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
<margo> Get it!
<margo> Why did I ever trust you?
<margo> Get the file. Otherwise you'll lose *all* your toys.
<bob> Listen to this bullshit. This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
<bob> It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
<phreak> His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.
<cereal> Oooo, look at that pooper man. Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right!
<joey> Uh, my name's Joey but, uh, I'm not an addict.
* joey takes a long drag on his cigarette
<joey> Nono, really, really, listen, listen to this. I got in trouble with my computer, right, okay, and my lawyer told the judge that I'm an addict, but I'm not addicted to my computer! No really, really, I'm not an addict. I'm not, I'm not. Can I get some more coffee?
<phreak> Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
<cereal> Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
<crash>  Was that her top?
<phreak> One-handed!
<cereal> Difficulty rating?
<nikon>  Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
<curtis> Oooh, Leopard Boy... AND the Decepticons. Uh, Kate, Kate, you're not going into that computer shit now, right? Kate barely acknowledges him.
<crash> I'm Crash Override.
<burn>  You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
<ceral> Whoa, whowhowhowhoa.
* cereal points at Dade
<cereal> Crash...
* cereal points at KAte
<cereal> and Burn!!
<plague> I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
<burn> It's too much machine for you.
<burn> I hope you don't screw like you type.
<burn>  P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
<crash> Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
<burn>  Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
<crash> Yeah. RISC is good.
<crash> RISC is good.
<burn> You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
<phreak> Use only the dialups, access codes and passwords in your collection. Can't ask for any help from us.
<crash> "Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking for discreet friend to bring dreams to reality. Leather, lace, and water sports. Transvestites welcome."
<gill> I... I... I know where you can stick it... I know where you can stick it...
<acct> This is accounting, sir. You enquired about an employee of ours, an Agent Richard Gill?
<gill> Yes.
<acct> Our records indicate he's deceased.
<gill> I'm what?
<crash>   Dead.
<phreak> Dead?
<crash> Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
<plague> You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool? Well let me explain the New World Order. Governments and corporations need people like you and me. We are samurai. The keyboard cowboys. And all those other people out there who have no idea what's going on are the cattle. Mooo! I need your help, you need my help. Let me help you earn your spurs. Ahh, think about it. Enjoy the laptop, "Cool"! Tell me where the disk is.
<phreak> Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
<phreak> Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
<phreak> Deja vu!
<phreak> What are you waiting for, arrest me already!
<cop> You get one call. Uno. Understand?
<phreak> It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
<mrsmurphy> Well, now I see what all the fuss is about.
<burn>  We need your help.
<crash> Do my ears deceive me?
<cereal> Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.
<crash>  ...
<burn>   ...
<cereal> What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
<mrsmurphy> Listen you guys, help yourself to anything in the fridge. Cereal has.
<plague> Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.%
<plague> What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid.
<plague> Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
<nikon>  Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
<cereal> Looks like a hacker wrote it.
<cereal> Tag, you're in.
<crash> This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
<cereal> Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
<nikon> Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
<crash> I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
* zerocool is now known as crashoverride
<nikon> Zero Cool? Crashed fifteen hundred and seven systems in one day?
<nikon> Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
<crash> I'll hack the Gibson.
<nikon> Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
<cereal> Oh wow, we are fried.
<burn> Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
<cereal> You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
<nikon> Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
<crash> Okay. Let's go shopping.
<crash> You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of honor, I might take advantage of this situation.  Erotically, as it were.
<burn> It's my subway defense system.
<nikon> Yo, brain dead, the manual!
<margo>  They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
<plague> Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
<plague> Look, there is no right and wrong.  There is only fun and boring. A thirty year prison sentence sounds pretty dull to me.  Who do you prefer serves it, us? Or them?
<gill> Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn, Emmanuel Goldstein, alias Cereal Killer, Dade Murphy, alias Crash Override, also known as Zero Cool, and Paul Cook, alias Lord Nikon. We pick them up tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.
<cereal> snoop onto them
<nikon>  as they snoop onto us
<nikon> Hey, Burn. We got a little problem here.
<crash> Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
<nikon> Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
<cereal> Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
<nikon>  Whoa, whoa. Yo, brain-dead, today is the thirteenth.
<cereal> A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
<cereal> May the Force be with you, man.
<burn> They're elite! Let's get 'em.
<crash> Ummm... we come in peace?
<burn>  ... We need your help.  If you're up to it.
<razor> She's buff... Ballsy.
<blade> Let's keep her.
<razor> Waste the dude.
<razor> Hackers of the World, Unite!
<cereal> Yo. I'm blowing up. It's Kate, Grand Central. Let's hit it!
<cereal> Yo. PM from Burn, Grand Central. Let's hit it!
<burn> Now listen up, use your best viruses to buy us time, we have to get into Plague's file and copy the worm.
<cereal> Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
<burn> Alright, let's boot up.
<hal> There's a new virus in the database.
<plague> Type "Cookie", you idiot. I'll head 'em off at the pass.
<plague> Type "Cookie", you idiot.
<hal> We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
<plague> Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
<plague> Die, dickweeds!
<hal>    The rabbit is in the administration system.
<plague> Send a Flu-shot.
<margo>  Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
<hal>    A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
<margo>  Cancer?
<burn> It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
<crash> Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
<plague> They're at Grand Central Station, lower level. Don't screw up.
<plague> Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
<crash>  Yeah, maybe I'm not. But *we* are, you asshole.
<razor> Are we fashionably late?
<sysop> We have massive infection.  Multiple GPI and FSI viruses.
<hal>   They're coming in from remote nodes. They're going after the Kernal!
<margo> Colonel who?
<hal>   The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
<margo> Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
<sysop> We have massive infection.  Multiple GPI and FSI viruses.
<hal>   They're coming in from remote nodes. They're going after the Kernal!
<margo> Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
<duke>   Belford, what's going on?
<plague> In short, Duke, a shit storm.
<plague> This is the end, my friend. Thank you for calling!
<nikon> Joey's getting stupid busy.
<crash> Joey. I need you to drop your viruses, go after the worm. You're the closest.
<crash> It's root slash period workspace slash period garbage period.
<crash> It's /root/.workspace/.garbage.
<burn> Kill the Gibson.
<plague> Come on you son of a bitch, is that all you got, huh? Come on, let's see what else you can do! You talking to me? Huh? Hahahaha. Are you nuts? Come at me! 
<hal> They're in the kernal.
ARF ARF! WE GOTCHA! MESS WITH THE BEST, DIE LIKE THE REST!
MESS WITH THE BEST, DIE LIKE THE REST!
<plague> Little pissant!
<crash> They're TRASHING our rights, man! They're TRASHING the flow of data! They're TRASHING! TRASHING! TRASHING! HACK THE PLANET! HACK THE PLANET!
<crash> HACK THE PLANET!!
<cereal> HACK THE PLANET!!
<gill> Shut up and get in the car!
<crash> Me, alright? I did it. She knows shit about computers. She... she's just my girlfriend.
<gill> I suggest you modify your attitude. Because you are floating. And I'm about to flush your ass.
<gill>      Your son is in big trouble. He has violated his probation and he has engaged in criminal activity.
<mrsmurphy> My son happens to be a genius. He understands something happening today that you won't comprehend if you live to be a hundred, and he would never use what he knows to harm a living soul.
<gill>      Your son is facing thirty felony counts in an ongoing investigation. You face possible arrest if you do that.
<mrsmurphy> Mister, I don't care if I face certain death.
<reporter> and attacked the Ellingson's computer network. Is the last we've seen of this type of high-tech espionage?
<gill>     Well, I'm afraid not. Hackers are a grave threat to the national security. This incident just proves without a doubt that we need increased funding to stop...
<cereal> Hold on, boys and girls. It is I, the Cereal Killer, making my first coast to coast, world wide, global television appearance. Yes, that's right, I'm here to tell you about this heinous scheme hatched from within Ellingson Mineral.
<cereal> But for what, you ask? World domination? Nay. Something far more tacky. A virus called Da Vinci, that when launched, would cause Ellingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be blamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was really the smokescreen, right. What could be so vitally important to protect that someone would create such a nasty, antisocial, very uncool virus program?
<cereal> But why? Could it be to cover the tracks for this worm program? A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks. The password for this hungry little sucker belongs to Margo Wallace, head of public relations at Ellingson Mineral...
<cereal> What's this? Is this the unnamed account in the Bahamas where the money was to be stashed? I think so!
<cereal> Yo. I kinda feel like God!
<margo> I don't even know how to work a VCR, let alone a computer! Get off! Look, listen, I'll make a deal. Eugene Belford! I know where his mother is, I promise you. Get offa me! I need a lawyer!
<plague> What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
<crash> You look good in a dress.
<crash> You look good in a dress.
<burn>  You would have looked better.
<burn>  I can't believe they decided you won.
<crash> They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
<burn>  Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
CRASH AND BURN
